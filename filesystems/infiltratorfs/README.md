# InfiltratorFS UEFI integration

InfiltratorOS Boot Manager includes InfiltratorFS as a first-class filesystem target.

This directory is the UEFI integration layer. It is deliberately based on the canonical portable InfiltratorFS format/core implementation rather than the Linux kernel VFS adapter; Linux kernel code cannot be used directly in UEFI.

## Source provenance

The initial UEFI port is pinned to Infiltrator-Projects/InfiltratorFS commit:

`0451f95cadf57484640d87eea2037e067bc7ed6f`

At that revision the project reports InfiltratorFS 0.18.94 / on-disk Format 0.18. The vendored source retains its original GPL-3.0-or-later notices and a copy of the InfiltratorFS GPLv3 licence.

## Architecture

The target architecture is read-only at boot time:

1. EFI Disk I/O is exposed to the portable InfiltratorFS reader through an `infs_storage` backend.
2. The canonical InfiltratorFS checkpoint, object, namespace, sparse-file, inline-data and compression logic remains authoritative.
3. rEFInd's FSW layer is used only as the EFI Simple File System bridge.
4. File data returned by InfiltratorFS is exposed through FSW buffer extents, so compressed or non-contiguous InfiltratorFS files do not need to be misrepresented as simple physical extents.
5. No filesystem writes are enabled in the boot manager.

The Linux `kernel/` implementation is not copied into the boot manager. The UEFI port follows the portable `include/infilfs` and `src` implementation so that there is one on-disk-format truth.

## Status

The portable source is vendored and pinned here first. The EFI storage and FSW adapter are then built around that source. The driver must not be added to the default filesystem build list until it can mount, enumerate directories, follow symlinks and read ordinary, sparse, inline and compressed files successfully.
